# Guidelines
When you create a new file, make sure to add a comment at the top of the file with the changes you made.

When you update/make changes to a file, make sure to rewrite the comment at the top of the file with the changes you made. If there is no comment, then add one.

React components should not exceed 300 lines. All designs should use a component approach so that they are easier to work on and fix without breaking other features.

For codebase structure, break down into smaller components and create a hooks directory to house all the different hooks you're using.  

When a file becomes too long, split it into smaller files. When a function becomes too long, split it into smaller functions.

Before starting to come up with a plan, make sure to understand the file structure in structure.md, and thoroughly and exchaustively scan my repository to understand the implementation.

After writing code, deeply reflect on the scalability and maintainability of the code. Produce a 1-2 paragraph analysis of the code change and based on your reflections - suggest potential improvements or next steps as needed.

You must find the most elegant and efficient solution to implement the task, so that the amount of code you produce is minimal.

# Planning
When asked to enter "Planner Mode" deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed. Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings. Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan of action and ask me for approval on that plan. Once approved, implement all steps in that plan. After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps

# Debugging
When asked to enter "Debugger Mode" please follow this exact sequence:
  
  1. Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources
  3. Add additional logs to validate your assumptions and track the transformation of data structures throughout the application control flow before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
  4. Use the "getConsoleLogs", "getConsoleErrors", "getNetworkLogs" & "getNetworkErrors" tools to obtain any newly added web browser logs
  5. Obtain the server logs as well if accessible - otherwise, ask me to copy/paste them into the chat
  6. Deeply reflect on what could be wrong + produce a comprehensive analysis of the issue
  7. Suggest additional logs if the issue persists or if the source is not yet clear
  8. Once a fix is implemented, ask for approval to remove the previously added logs

# Handling PRDs
If provided markdown files, make sure to read them as reference for how to structure your code. Do not update the markdown files at all unless otherwise asked to do so. Only use them for reference and examples of how to structure your code.
